# C Programming Journey at GLS University

This repository documents my learning journey and achievements in the introductory C programming course at GLS University during my first semester. It serves as a collection of code examples, notes, and exercises I completed throughout the course.

**About Me:**

I completed the introductory C programming course at GLS University during my first semester. This repository showcases the skills and knowledge I gained during that time.

**Technologies Used:**

* C


**Repository Structure:**

This repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific area of C programming:

* **`basics/`:**  Contains fundamental concepts like variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
* **`functions/`:**  Examples and exercises related to defining and using functions in C.
* **`arrays/`:**  Code demonstrating the use of arrays in C.
* **`pointers/`:**  This section specifically focuses on my learning journey with pointers. You'll find code examples and notes that reflect my initial struggles and eventual understanding of this concept.
* **`patterns/`:**  This directory contains my attempts and solutions to various pattern-printing problems. It highlights my initial difficulties with nested loops and visualizing the logic required to generate different patterns.
* **`practice_problems/`:**  Solutions to practice problems assigned in the course or found through self-study.


**My Learning Journey - Highlights and Challenges:**

During the C programming course, I gained a foundational understanding of key programming concepts. While the initial stages had their challenges, particularly with certain topics:

* **Patterns:**  Understanding how to effectively utilize nested `for` loops for pattern generation was a significant learning curve. Through practice and problem-solving, I developed the ability to visualize the loop flow and translate that into code. The `patterns/` directory showcases my progression in this area, including my initial attempts and successful solutions.
* **Pointers:**  The concept of pointers, memory addresses, and dereferencing initially felt abstract. However, by working through examples, drawing memory diagrams, and understanding their relationship with arrays, I developed a solid grasp of pointer fundamentals. The `pointers/` directory reflects this learning process.

Completing this course has provided me with a strong foundation in procedural programming with C. I learned valuable skills in problem-solving, logical thinking, and translating requirements into code.

**Future Goals:**

While this repository focuses on my completed C programming course, I am now focusing on Data Structures and Flutter . The skills I gained in C, such as understanding memory management and low-level operations, will undoubtedly be valuable in my future programming endeavors.

**Getting Started:**

To run the C code in this repository, you will need a C compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ishawn1/gls-uni-c-learning
2. **Navigate to the directory containing the .c file you want to compile:**
   ```   
   cd [directory name]
3. **Compile the code using GCC:** 
   ```
   gcc [filename].c -o [executable_name]
4. **Run the executable:**
   ```
   ./[executable_name]
