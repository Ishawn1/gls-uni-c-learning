# C Programming Practice Problems

This directory contains solutions to various practice problems in C programming. The problems are organized into separate problem sets, each focusing on different aspects of the language and problem-solving techniques.

**Overview:**

This collection of practice problems is intended to help solidify my understanding of C programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills. Each problem set focuses on a specific set of challenges, ranging from basic syntax and logic to more complex algorithmic tasks.

**Directory Structure:**

This directory is organized into the following subfolders, each representing a problem set:

* **`Task-1/`:** Basic arithmetic and conditional statements.
* **`Task-2/`:** Looping structures (while).
* **`Task-3/`:** Working with Switch.
* **`Task-4/`:** Looping structures (for).
* **`Task-5/`:** Working with functions
* **`Task-6/`:** Working with array
* **`Task-7/`:** Working with structure

**Content of Each Problem Set Folder:**

Each `Task-X/` folder will contain:

* **`1.c`**, `2.c`, `3.c`, etc.: C source code files containing my solutions to the corresponding problems.

**How to Use This Directory:**

1. **Examine the `X.c` files** to see my solution to each problem.
2. **To compile and run a solution:**
   ```bash
   gcc X.c -o X
   ./X
