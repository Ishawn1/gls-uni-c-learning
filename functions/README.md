# Functions in C Programming

This directory explores the concept of functions in C programming, a crucial aspect of modular and organized code. The examples here demonstrate how to define, declare, and call functions, along with understanding function parameters and return values.

**Overview:**

Functions allow you to break down complex programs into smaller, manageable, and reusable blocks of code. This section covers the syntax for defining functions, passing data to functions through parameters, and receiving results back from functions using return values.

**Files:**

* **`function_declarations.c`:** This file focuses on the declaration of functions in C. It demonstrates:
    * The basic syntax for declaring a function (return type, function name, parameter list).
    * The purpose of function prototypes and why they are important (especially for functions defined after their first use).

* **`function_calls.c`:** This file demonstrates how to call or invoke functions in a C program. It showcases:
    * The syntax for calling a function.
    * Passing arguments to functions with parameters.
    * Handling return values from functions (assigning them to variables or using them directly).
    * Examples of calling functions defined in the same file and potentially functions declared in header files (though not the main focus here).

**Key Concepts Covered:**

* **Function Definition:** Understanding the structure of a function definition, including the return type, function name, parameter list, and function body.
* **Function Declaration (Prototype):**  Knowing how to declare a function before its definition, allowing it to be called from other parts of the code.
* **Function Call:**  Learning the syntax for invoking a function and passing arguments.
* **Parameters (Arguments):** Understanding how to pass data to functions.
* **Return Values:**  Understanding how functions can return a value to the calling code using the `return` statement.

**How to Run the Code:**

To compile and run the C code in this directory:

1. **Save the `.c` files** to your local machine.
2. **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
3. **Navigate to the `functions/` directory** within your repository.
4. **Compile a file using a C compiler (like GCC):**
   ```bash
   gcc [filename].c -o [executable_name]
5. **5. Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./[executable_name]
